package StringReversal;//Convert the input string into character array by using the toCharArray():
// Convert the input string into character array by using the toCharArray() â€“ built in method of the String Class.
// Then, scan the character array from both sides i.e from the start index (left) as well as from last index(right) simultaneously.

//1. Set the left index equal to 0 and right index equal to the length of the string -1.
//2. Swap the characters of the start index scanning with the last index scanning
//   one by one. After that, increase the left index by 1 (left++) and decrease the right
//   by 1 i.e., (right--) to move on to the next characters in the character array .
//3. Continue till left is less than or equal to the right.
